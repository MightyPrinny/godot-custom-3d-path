Port of the path editor written in C# with modifications
to make path editing easier.


Right now the only change is the ability to restrict te axes
in which you move the point handles.
Shortcut keys(press multiple to combine the effects):
Z: Move only on X axis
X:Move only on Z axis
C:Move only on Y axis
